# MT Activity Management Mobile UI

A mobile application built in Flutter for tracking activities within
a specific time period, with the ability to tag one's programs as public,
creating the possibility for other users to view others' programs they deem
valuable enough to share and help others. It also includes a system for
self-registration and login, so individual representation is recorded,
allowing for the identification of the creator of a specific program shared with everyone.
Currently, users can create programs for training, nutrition, and supplements for
individual days and track both their own and others' programs and activities
during the day and generally over a period of time.
